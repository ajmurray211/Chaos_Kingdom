## Project Description

This is a game that allows two players to move units on a map and if those two units collide or you land on an enemy owned city a fight will launch. The fight will take two players in a top down view and allow them to run around a stationary map and battle. The last one remaining wins, the main game continues and the map is altered based off of the results. The game continues until all positions are captured or someone quits.
